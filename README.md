# Bubble Sort Algorithm - C Implementation

A basic **Bubble Sort** algorithm implemented in C. This algorithm sorts an array of integers in **ascending order** using a basic comparison approach.

## 🎮 How to Use:
1. The program prompts you to enter the **length of the array**.
2. Then, you'll input **N numbers** that you want to sort.
3. The program will sort the array using the **Bubble Sort** algorithm.
4. The sorted array will be printed on the screen.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **C Programming**
- **Loops** (for, while)
- **Array manipulation** and **element swapping**

## 🚀 Getting Started:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShadBuilds/Bubble-Sort
```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

```bash
cd Bubble-Sort
```

3. **Compile the program using GCC:**

```bash
gcc bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
```

4. **Run the program:**

```bash
./bubble_sort
```

## 🧑‍💻 Algorithm Explanation:
1. **Bubble Sort** works by repeatedly stepping through the list.
2. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
3. This process repeats until no more swaps are needed, meaning the array is sorted.

### Example Output:
```
Enter the length of the array: 5
Enter elements of the array:
34 12 45 9 2

Sorted array: 2 9 12 34 45
```
